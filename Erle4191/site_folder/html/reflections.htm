<h2>Reflections</h2>
</br>
<p>
    At the start of this class, the thought of creating my own website seemed beyond daunting. I felt that whatever it is I ended up making wouldn't be something I would happy with. </br>
    </br>
    Having already had poor feedback from a different class that was reliant on my creativity, suffice to say I didn’t come into this with much hope at my side. The content of the class itself, to me, wasn’t that much a challenge. But this final project always seemed to loom ahead. </br>
    </br>
    While this may be a bit insensitive to say, the moment when I felt that I could do this, is when I looked at the other websites from previous students. Some had good ideas that helped me gain perspective as how to do my own website. But it was the less than stellar examples that made me think, “I can design something better than this, I can design something better in my sleep!” A bit of arrogance aside, I want to say that I admire their efforts of everyone that came before. Creating a website, especially if you have little computer experience or maybe when English is your second language, can be an incredibly daunting task to take on. It was same for myself though with different circumstances behind the inhibitions. I touched on this in my home page message, but the feeling of not be able to create anything that I thought was worthwhile, let-alone something that anyone else would think was good, felt like it was a mountain I had to climb without any rope. </br>
    </br>
    As far as experience goes, I had some basic knowledge of HTML from high school and had learned a bit on my own while working with the EPUB format (portable book format that is HTML based) for an online volunteer group. But as far as CSS was concerned, and jQuery more so, I was more lost than a fly in a rain storm. The lessons, assignments, readings, and yes even the discussions for this class helped immensely along the way. Having a clear and precise direction with each assignment was probably the most helpful aspect of this this. Being able to look back at past assignments during the coding process was quite helpful if there was an area I wasn’t 100% clear on. </br>
    </br>
    In the end it didn’t take all that long to get the start I needed. It only took two days to put the site framework together and hash out what I needed for each page. Most of the time spent before reaching this point was spent doing two things, thinking (the hard part) and iterating in the direction I wanted to go as far the design was concerned. </br>
    </br>
    Like all my projects (you would think I would have learned this lesson by now) most of the time spent after reaching that point was spent making headaches for myself when I wanted to add an extra feature here, or a format adjustment there. While thankfully I didn’t break the whole thing in the process, I wasn’t able to fully tune all the things I added to my desired standard. For instance, for the logo of the web site that is present on all pages. It has a small aesthetic animation that when the user’s mouse is hovered on either the “/Information” or “Curiosity/” image that causes it to slide to the side that it is supposed to be referring to. But the problem is that the animation plays on an infinite loop with EVERY mouse hover input. Creating for a very poor look especially if you have a sensitive mouse. Again, this is was an added extra that I THOUGHT I would have the time for once I had everything else arranged. While it wasn’t ideal, it was what I ended up with.</br>Afterall, what’s life without a few surprises?</br>
