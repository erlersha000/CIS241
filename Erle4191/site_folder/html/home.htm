<h2>Hello World.</h2>
</br>
<p>My name is Shaun Erler, I am a recent (as of this writing) graduate from Edmonds Community College earning an Associates of the Arts. I was born and raised here in the pacific northwest and I enjoy reading books, playing video games, graphic design, and customizing my computer. Currently I am still furthering my education to become a full-fledged Graphic Designer who specializes in multi-faceted approaches toward the ever-evolving field of functional design.</br>
    My plans are to apply for the Interactive Media Design Program at the University of Washington Bothell and earn a bachelor’s degree in the field. Since coming to Edmonds, I have been able to pursue a degree path that I have thoroughly enjoyed and have gained new perspective because of it. </br>
    </br>
    I see this website as a true milestone. For the last six-odd months I have been plague with a nigh-unshakable feeling of being uncreative. As my first real attempt at producing something that I enjoyed making, I can say that I am genuinely satisfied with the results. In retrospect, I’m sure I sure I will be able to point out its flaws and beginner mistakes, but in the here and now, I think I've done an okay job. I have always liked computers and coding to a certain extent and having the opportunity to make something that I can look back on and not feel disgusted by the sight of it, gives me a feeling of pride and accomplishment.
